This project, which is just starting, is for an educational puzzle game. The abilities developed in it should map pretty directly to the memorization and writing of Chinese-origin Japanese characters called kanji.

While the mechanics have not been completely developed, under the current concept they involve the metaphor of a string of yarn coming in and out of holes of a piece of cardboard and bending around pins, giving form to the characters.

My current goal is to finish a prototype with the core mechanics before seeking funding to complete the project. The resulting game will however be free and open source.
